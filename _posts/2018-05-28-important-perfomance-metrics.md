## Occupancy (OCC)

This is the percentage that shows how many nights were sold for any given period. It is calculated by number of nights that were sold by the total number of nights the listing was available for bookings for any given period.

## Average Daily Rate (ADR) 

It represents the simple average of all rates guests paid for one night of their stay on any given night. Because guests each pay different rates for their respective stays, ADR sums them all up and averages them into one single rate. It is calculated by dividing total listing revenue for the night by total number of nights sold for any given period.

## Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)

The most comprehensive and important metric hosts depend on to make smart decisions is RevPAR. It blends Occupancy (OCC) with Average Daily Rate (ADR) but also includes the impact of your unsold nights, giving you a true picture of profitability and success. It is calculated by multiplying Occupancy (OCC) by Average Daily Rate (ADR) for any given time period. It is the first metric a host would want to look at when analyzing the health of a listing. 

## Estimated Yearly Revenue (EYR)

This is simply the Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) multiplied with 365. This is a estimation what revenue can be achieved with a listing per year based on the selected period for RevPAR and OCC.


## Market Penetration Index (MPI)

Also referred to as an Occupancy Index, the MPI is a key comparison metric: MPI compares your listing's share of business in your market to your competitors, giving you a picture of your share in the overall market occupancy rate (how big a slice of the pie you’re getting in your market).

You can calculate it by dividing your listings’s occupancy rate by the occupancy of your competitors and multiplying the result with 100. Any number below 100 will mean that you are not getting your fair share of the demand in your market and any number over 100 means that you’re doing an excellent job and in fact stealing business from your competitors. MPI is the first metric that shows how you are doing compared to others in your industry.

## Average Rate Index (ARI)

ARI is used to measure a listings’s ADR performance compared to it's competitor. You find ARI by dividing your listing's  ADR by your competitive set’s ADR and multiplying the result by 100. Analyzing fair share principle is same as MPI, where any number below 100 indicates poor performance, while anything above 100 is excellent.

## Revenue Generated Index (RGI)

Also known as the RevPAR Index, RGI blends MPI and ARI to show you a more complete performance snapshot compared with your competitors. MPI and ARI alone are not enough to show all the details. For example, you might have achieved excellent results in your MPI that are above 100 while your ARI might have suffered. It means that you sold your nights at rates lower than your market can absorb. While you might have stolen occupancy share from your competitors, if your ARI is much lower than 100, then your competitors might have potentially reached the same revenue total as yours with less effort at a lower cost, increasing their profit per night sold. Your RGI metric will help solve tthis for you.

Lately I found something interesting in the Airbnb host form [Turning instant booking on and off](https://airhostsforum.com/t/turning-instant-booking-on-and-off/22134):

> I remember someone saying that one can boost the listing rankings just by simply turning the instant book feature off, and then on again. Do you guys have any experience with this? I couldâ€™ve sworn I read that on this forum, but I cannot remember whose advice it was. 


This aroused my curiosity as Airbnb hst and a data analysis. So I was setting up a litle test to behavior.

A question, that is often arising from our customers:

***Is my listing part of high competitive market or not?***

Actually it's not about competition, you also have to consider the demand if you are in "good" or "bad" market.

Imagine a city with a lot of Airbnb listings and a lack of hotel beds. You might have high density of airbnb listings and your conclusion would be that you are in a very competitive market. On the other site you have a lot of visitors and most of the listings are booked out through the year. Congratulation, you are part of "good" market. We call this 


In our [Airbnb Local Market Analysis](/products/airbnb_local_market_analysis/) on the first tab we have an overview on four
different metrics, which provide you a hint on how competitive your local market is:

   * Listing density:  This metric shows how many listings there are square kilometer. In the major cities in the world this number is around
   * Median Estimated Yearly Revenue: This is the Estimated Yearly Revenue ([Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)) for all listings. It's based on booked out dates and the rate for the date for the next 6 months.
   * Median Average Daily Rate: This is the median of the daily rates, for dates that are booked out
   * Median Occupancy: This is median occupancy for all listings.  It's based on booked out dates and the rate for the date for the next 6 months.

To show you the difference we picked out four cities in the world to make a comparison.

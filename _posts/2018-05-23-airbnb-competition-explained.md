A question, that is often arising:

> ***Is my listing part of high competitive market or not?***

Well, what is a competitive market? 

Is the number of competitors the only important aspect?

No, definitely not. We have to consider the demand for a regional Airbnb market as well.

Let's think about different scenarios:

   1. Imagine a city with a lot of Airbnb listings and a lack of hotel beds. You might have high density of airbnb listings and your conclusion would be that you are in a very competitive market and this is bad. On the other site you have a lot of visitors and most of the listings are booked out through the year. 
So the overall occupancy in the area is high. Yes, the market is competitive, but it simply does not matter too much as you will most probably have a high occupancy. Your are part of a **high competitive undersatured market**.
   2. We assume now you are in market with a lot of competitors around you, unfortunately the demand for accommodation is distributed across the competitors resulting in a low occupancy for everybody. This is not the best situation. We call this a **high competitive oversatured market** 
   3. Let's check the opposite: You are one of a few listings in your area and you get many bookings as there is a lack of alternatives. This situation is also good. This is called a **low competitive undersatured market**
   4. Last but not least: Like before you are one of a few listings in your area, but there are as well a few visitors in your area. This is the situation which is actually bad. We call this a **low competitive oversatured market**



In our [Airbnb Local Market Analysis](/products/airbnb_local_market_analysis/) on the first tab we have an overview on four
different metrics, which provide you local market is:

   * Listing density:  This metric shows how many listings there are square kilometer. In the major cities in the world this number is around
   * Median Estimated Yearly Revenue: This is the Estimated Yearly Revenue ([Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)) for all listings. It's based on booked out dates and the rate for the date for the next 6 months.
   * Median Average Daily Rate: This is the median of the daily rates, for dates that are booked out
   * Median Occupancy: This is median occupancy for all listings.  It's based on booked out dates and the rate for the date for the next 6 months.

To show you the difference we picked out four cities in the world to make a comparison.

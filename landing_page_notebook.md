## Landing Page Layout

### 1.  Unique Value Proposition

If people can’t determine the purpose of your page from the main headline (and subhead) you’re doing something wrong. If this is the case, try asking a colleague to describe what you do. Often, hearing someone else communicate it will strengthen your own understanding and to help you craft an effective USP.

#### Reinforcement Statemnt 

Use a reinforcement statement to highlight another key benefit of your product or service. It should work hand in hand with your main headline to extend your value proposition.

#### Closing Argument

As your landing page comes to a close, you have one final chance to communicate the benefit of your offering. Similar to the reinforcement statement, it backs up your main value proposition. For a click-through page, it should be coupled with a repeat of your call-to-action.
	 

### 2. Hero Shot

The hero shot is the best photograph or graphical image of your product or service, designed to make it stand out as something worth attaining. In this case it’s the image of an ebook. Notice how it dominates the page.

Your hero shot should dominate the page, making it immediately clear what the page is about. Your USP should reinforce the product shot and vice-versa. If they don’t work together, the audience will become confused.


### 3. Benefits

#### Benefit Statements (Bullets)

Following the other elements on your page, you should by now have the attention of your visitor. It’s here that the benefits of your product/service should be highlighted in plain form. Bullet points should be used for easy scanning.

Your benefit statements should attach directly to the pain felt by people seeking out what you are offering. An example (for a dishwasher) being “Saves you hours every week by cleaning your dishes for you”. As opposed to a feature such as “Cleans dishes”.

Benefit statements explain how you are solving a problem that your prospects have. Ask yourself “What do my potential customers need?”, then write down one sentence solutions to those needs.

#### Detailed Benefit & Feature Descriptions

To support your brief benefit statements you want to extend the bullet point descriptions into a more detailed overview of their purpose and benefit. A good way to approach this is to expand upon the benefits first, and then if needed, add some feature details below.

The important point to remember here is that you need to communicate the benefit of your offering first. Then, and only then, do you start to add features – which are typically directed towards those who require more detail in order to make a decision.

The benefits describe the problem you are solving, and the features describe what it does.

You often want to include imagery here that shows how each feature will look when being used, such as screenshots, where applicable. You can also use icons that represent the feature.

### 4. Proof

Social proof is a powerful persuasive concept. Simply put it’s the use of social signals to illustrate that other people have bought/consumed/read/participated in, what you are offering. The concept being that you are more likely to convert if you see that others before you have, and were glad they did.


### 5. Call To Action

Your conversion goal is a term that describes what the purpose of the page is to you. It’s purely a label intended to keep you focused on this page element when designing your page.

To a visitor, this is presented in the form of a Call-To-Action (CTA), which can either be a standalone button on a click-through page, or as part of a lead gen form.

Your CTA is critical to conversions as it’s the target of your pages’ conversion goal – in other words, it’s what you want people to interact with on your landing page. How you design it, where you place it and what it says are all important considerations.

#### CTA Design

Often, the best way to understand the design of CTAs is to look at examples for inspiration. This classic post from Smashing Magazine has a large collection of call-to-action examples.

Tip: We’ll cover a more detailed explanation of CTA design later on in the course.

#### CTA Copy

A simple guiding principle for CTAs is that the copy (text) on your button, should describe exactly what will happen when it’s clicked. Examples of this would include: “Get my free ebook now”, “Take the 5 minute tour”, “Start my 30-day free trial”.

Tip: It can help if you try to complete the sentence “I want to…” with your CTA copy, for instance I want to… “Download my free ebook now”.

### The Confirmation page

	- The opportunity for more subtle follow-up marketing: keeping people within the sphere of marketing influence if they follow or share on social media.

	- The opportunity to exceed expectations: differentiate by being the best. Surprise people with a bonus extra offer or content download.

	- The chance to offer info/advice that would have crowded your landing page: if you wanted to convey a message that wasn’t appropriate for your landing page (as you were rightfully keeping it focused on a single message), you now have the opportunity to do so.

	- The chance to offer a guided experience: most people like direction. Offer a suggestion of what to do next.


## Landing Page Copywriting

The words on your page are the most important elements to consider when creating a landing page. Your words are the first thing people pay attention to when the page loads, and the last thing they read before deciding whether or not they will complete your conversion goal.


### 1. Taking Inventory

	- The headline
	- The subheader
	- Introductory paragraph
    - Benefits/feature bullet points
	- The form header
	- Call-to-action copy
	- Privacy statements
	- Testimonials (though you don’t write these, they’re part of your copy)


### 2. Crafting An Effective Headline

Your headline has one job and one job only. To get your visitors to continue engaging with your message, increase their desire for what you’re offering, and motivate a Call-To-Action click. That’s why when it comes to crafting effective landing page headlines, choose clarity over clever.

Clever calls attention to itself at the expense of the message.

### 3. Writing A Call To Action

According to Michael Aagaard, your call-to-action represents the tipping point between bounce and conversion. When you ask someone to do something online, they have to go through your call-to-action in order to do it – regardless of whether you’re asking them to download a PDF, fill out a form, buy a product, or even just click through to another page.

This means that clicking the CTA is a mission-critical conversion goal, and every extra click potentially means money in the bank.

Michael recommends asking yourself 2 questions in order to optimize your call-to-action copy:

1. What is my prospect’s motivation for clicking this button?
2. What is my prospect going to get, when he/she clicks this button?

The answers to those 2 questions are going to be the basis for the new button copy. You’ll have to spend time tweaking and refining it before it’s ready for testing, but asking these questions is a great way to get started.

Let’s use a gym membership call-to-action as an example:

1. The prospects’ motivation is to get a membership in a local gym.
2. When they click the button, they’ll get the opportunity to find a gym and buy their membership.

This leaves our final button copy as: “Find gym and get membership”


### 4. Privacy Stating Tips

The privacy policy statements you add to your lead generation forms can have a significant impact on how people perceive your trustworthiness, in turn affecting your conversion rates. Michael Aagaard ran some A/B test experiments on this in order to determine which type of messaging works best.

In the first experiment, the original form (with no privacy statement) was tested against a version that said “100% privacy – we will never spam you” beneath the call-to-action. The results of this were surprising.

### 5. Writing Benefit Statements


Listing the features of your offering requires your visitors to figure out for themselves how your product or service can help them.

A more effective way to communicate how you’ll solve their problems is to talk in terms of benefits. This lets you speak directly to the needs of your visitors as opposed to talking about yourself.

Copyblogger provides great insight into all kinds of copywriting, including an excellent technique for turning your feature descriptions into benefit driven statements.

##### How to turn your features into benefits

Copyblogger recommends a 4 step process to extract the benefits from your features, to find the underlying desires of your prospects. Using a WordPress blog theme as an example, here’s how you can create your own benefit statements:    

1. List all of your product’s features. Narrowed down to the features that are most likely to hook your prospect:

	- Point-and-click site design controls
	- Mobile responsive layouts
	- One-click automatic theme updates
	
2. Examine what each feature does, or why you’ve included it:

	- Easily customizes your site in fewer steps
	- Adjusts to fit any device, hand-held, tablet or PC
	- Keeps your site updated and secure at the click of a button
	- 
3. Take your list of what your features do and ask yourself how they connect with your prospect’s true desires:

	- The ease and ability to change your own website in minutes without the need or expense of a developer
	- No complaints from customers that they can’t find your product or services or see your site’s content correctly on their mobile device
	- No more worrying about hours of redesigning or coding to get your site to look the way it did before platform updates
	- 
3. To get to the bottom of each feature’s true benefit, keep asking the question “What does this mean for your prospect on an emotional level?”:

	- Freedom and flexibility from having to pay a developer every time you want to change something on your website, and full creative control at your fingertips
	- The relief and happiness of knowing that your prospects will always be able to get in touch with you or buy your product or services no matter what device they are using
	- The confidence that your website is secure, looking great, and working for you regardless of how many versions of WordPress come out


### 6. Customer Writes for You

According to Copyhackers founder Joanna Weibe, if you want know what messages to put on your landing page, you can swipe it from your visitors, customers and prospects. The more you reflect what people are thinking, feeling and experiencing when they arrive on your landing page, the greater the likelihood that they will trust you, believe you’ve created the solution to their problems and buy from you.

In this example, a testimonial was used to extract a benefit statement of the solution offered on a landing page and use it in a new headline.

# Landing Page

- Remove all links, navigation, just call to action (attention ratio = 1!)

### Example Landing Page

![Full landing page example](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/xwjEfbIQT4eADWEtVyUG)

### 1.  Unique Value Proposition

If people can’t determine the purpose of your page from the main headline (and subhead) you’re doing something wrong. If this is the case, try asking a colleague to describe what you do. Often, hearing someone else communicate it will strengthen your own understanding and to help you craft an effective USP.

#### Reinforcement Statemnt

Use a reinforcement statement to highlight another key benefit of your product or service. It should work hand in hand with your main headline to extend your value proposition.

#### Closing Argument

As your landing page comes to a close, you have one final chance to communicate the benefit of your offering. Similar to the reinforcement statement, it backs up your main value proposition. For a click-through page, it should be coupled with a repeat of your call-to-action.

#### Example

##### Webpage Builder

_Main headline_: The Easiest Way to Build, Publish and Test Landing Pages Without I.T.

_Reinforcement statement_: Create beautiful landing pages in minutes with no HTML

##### Student Loans

_Main headline_: Save Thousands on Your Student Dept

_Subhead_: Refinance interest rates as low as 1.90%

_Reinforcement statement_: Submit one form, receive multiple offers

_Reinforcement statement_: Access options from many  of the best loean lenders

_Closing statement_: Stop overpaying on your student debt

##### Yoga

_Main headline_: Get Paid to Lead a Yoga Retreat

_Subhead_: We take the hassle out of planning your retrait, so you can focus on the students

_Reinforcement statement_: Easys Planning with our retreat wizard

_Closing statement_: Your group is waiting

### 2. Hero Shot

The hero shot is the best photograph or graphical image of your product or service, designed to make it stand out as something worth attaining. In this case it’s the image of an ebook. Notice how it dominates the page.

Your hero shot should dominate the page, making it immediately clear what the page is about. Your USP should reinforce the product shot and vice-versa. If they don’t work together, the audience will become confused.

### 3. Benefits

#### Benefit Statements (Bullets)

Following the other elements on your page, you should by now have the attention of your visitor. It’s here that the benefits of your product/service should be highlighted in plain form. Bullet points should be used for easy scanning.

Your benefit statements should attach directly to the pain felt by people seeking out what you are offering. An example (for a dishwasher) being “Saves you hours every week by cleaning your dishes for you”. As opposed to a feature such as “Cleans dishes”.

Benefit statements explain how you are solving a problem that your prospects have. Ask yourself “What do my potential customers need?”, then write down one sentence solutions to those needs.

#### Detailed Benefit & Feature Descriptions

To support your brief benefit statements you want to extend the bullet point descriptions into a more detailed overview of their purpose and benefit. A good way to approach this is to expand upon the benefits first, and then if needed, add some feature details below.

The important point to remember here is that you need to communicate the benefit of your offering first. Then, and only then, do you start to add features – which are typically directed towards those who require more detail in order to make a decision.

The benefits describe the problem you are solving, and the features describe what it does.

You often want to include imagery here that shows how each feature will look when being used, such as screenshots, where applicable. You can also use icons that represent the feature.

### 4. Proof

Social proof is a powerful persuasive concept. Simply put it’s the use of social signals to illustrate that other people have bought/consumed/read/participated in, what you are offering. The concept being that you are more likely to convert if you see that others before you have, and were glad they did.

### 5. Call To Action

Your conversion goal is a term that describes what the purpose of the page is to you. It’s purely a label intended to keep you focused on this page element when designing your page.

To a visitor, this is presented in the form of a Call-To-Action (CTA), which can either be a standalone button on a click-through page, or as part of a lead gen form.

Your CTA is critical to conversions as it’s the target of your pages’ conversion goal – in other words, it’s what you want people to interact with on your landing page. How you design it, where you place it and what it says are all important considerations.

#### CTA Design

Often, the best way to understand the design of CTAs is to look at examples for inspiration. This classic post from Smashing Magazine has a large collection of call-to-action examples.

Tip: We’ll cover a more detailed explanation of CTA design later on in the course.

#### CTA Copy

A simple guiding principle for CTAs is that the copy (text) on your button, should describe exactly what will happen when it’s clicked. Examples of this would include: “Get my free ebook now”, “Take the 5 minute tour”, “Start my 30-day free trial”.

Tip: It can help if you try to complete the sentence “I want to…” with your CTA copy, for instance I want to… “Download my free ebook now”.

### The Confirmation page

- The opportunity for more subtle follow-up marketing: keeping people within the sphere of marketing influence if they follow or share on social media.
- The opportunity to exceed expectations: differentiate by being the best. Surprise people with a bonus extra offer or content download.
- The chance to offer info/advice that would have crowded your landing page: if you wanted to convey a message that wasn’t appropriate for your landing page (as you were rightfully keeping it focused on a single message), you now have the opportunity to do so.
- The chance to offer a guided experience: most people like direction. Offer a suggestion of what to do next.

## Call To Action Design and Where To Put It on Your Page

Your call-to-action (CTA) is one of the most important elements on your page. It’s the final point of interaction and the last opportunity to convert your visitors.

> Your call-to-action represents a handshake agreement between you and your prospects.

### 1. CTA Placement

There are generally two ways to look at the placement of your call-to-action. Above the fold and below the fold. Which location you choose comes down to the complexity of your offer.

#### 1a. CTA Above the Fold

Placing your CTA above the fold is the most common placement choice. However, this can be expecting too much of someone who has just arrived at your page. A solution to this is to create a mini landing page experience that contains the critical elements of your page packaged up into a block of content above the fold. Then any supporting content can appear below for those who need to read it to be convinced of your page’s purpose.

The benefit to this approach is that it can increase the understanding of what your page is about very quickly, helping to reduce bounce rates.

##### The 6-point punch

1. A powerful and descriptive headline: The type that stops you in your tracks when you see it in a newspaper dispenser on the street.

2. A complimentary supporting sub header: This is designed to to give you both the ability to keep your headline short and sweet, and to provide the extra information that would make your headline a bloated mess if it was included.

3. The hero shot: This is your best photo/video that showcases your offering. The best style of hero shot is something that shows your product/service being used in context. For instance, for a foldaway step ladder, you could show a series of photos of it being used to reach a high shelf, followed by it being neatly stowed away in a tight space.

4. Benefit statements: These should succinctly describe the core benefits of your product or service and the pain your offering solves for prospects.

5. A call-to-action that describes exactly what you’ll get: This should be really closely tied to the title to reinforce your page’s purpose.

6. Confidence/trust indicators: This is where you back up your claims with a testimonial, customer logos press mention logos.

#### 1a. CTA Below the Fold

Some marketers might remember a concept called AIDA.

It stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action, and is based on the idea that a visitor progresses through a series of linear steps on their way to making a decision to take action.

The page below illustrates this flow, and is a good example of placing the CTA at the bottom of the page once the visitor has followed the progression of your marketing story.

Let’s break down the template to illustrate how it follows the AIDA principles:

_ATTENTION:_ You capture the attention of your visitor with a highly relevant and punchy headline.

_INTEREST:_ Through the use of the video, you gain the interest of your visitor.

_DESIRE:_ Desire is created through the use of features and benefits that appeal to the needs of your visitor.

_ACTION:_ And finally, a strong call-to-action completes the story at the point where your visitor has been convinced that your solution is appropriate for their needs. In this case, it uses contrast and color and defines what you’ll get when you click the button, with a little extra nudge in the copy beside the button.

If you can turn your page’s message into a story, then the AIDA approach can be a very effective way to build a landing page.

#### 1c. When Should You Place Your CTA Below the Fold

 The diagram below (from the KISSmetrics blog) demonstrates the correlation between the level of complexity and the best choice of placement on your landing page.

![Where to place CTA](https://d9hhrg4mnvzow.cloudfront.net/thelandingpagecourse.com/call-to-action-design-cta-buttons/a983508c-cta-placement-complexity.png)

If the product/offer is very simple, and the prospect doesn’t have to do much thinking in order to make an informed decision, positioning the CTA above the fold generally works best.

If the product/offer is complex, and the prospect has to digest a lot of information in order to make an informed decision, positioning the CTA lower on the page generally works best.

Tests have shown that for pages that require a high level of trust – such as those in the health industry – the page performs better by letting visitors read the full story before asking them to convert.

In an experiment by Marketing Experiments, they found that by moving the call-to-action right to the bottom of a long page, the reader was able to digest the amount of information suitable for the purpose of the page – rather than being asked right away to fill in a form, which applied unnecessary friction to the original page.

### The 8 guidelines of effective button design

Applying these foundational rules to your button designs will help increase the chances of them standing out for your visitors and being clicked more often.

#### Contrast

Contrasting colors are the best way to make your button stand out from the rest of the page. Choose the color that makes it stand out the best, rather than the color you like the best.

#### Clickability

Make it look like a button! If it looks flat and unclickable it could be just another design element on the page. Give it some kind of 3D design (without making it look like it was designed in the 90s). You can also increase the feeling of interaction by including a rollover state where the color or depth changes when you hover the mouse over it.

#### Size

Size matters. If your button is buried on the page it’s less likely to be clear that it’s the target element for a conversion. Go big or (your visitors will) go home.

#### Directional cues

Pointing to your call-to-action is a great way to make it stand out, and guide your prospects attention to where you want them to click. Here’s an example of a button design that performed better than the version without by 12.29% (test performed by

#### Call-to-action copy

The text on your button is of paramount importance. As a general rule it should describe exactly what will happen when it’s clicked. For instance: “Download my free ebook” or “Request a consultation callback”. Never use something like “Submit” or “Click here” – they don’t describe what will happen.

#### Supporting information

A short statement that supports and clarifies the purpose of the button can allow you to keep the CTA copy short and to the point, while adding extra detail. This text is typically smaller in size than the main button text and sits either inside or below the button.

#### Urgency

If there is a time or quantity limitation on your offer, be sure to re-state it beside your button to encourage the click. For the text on your button, try including words like “Now” or “Today”.

#### Whitespace

Where is the button? If that’s the response of your visitors you aren’t making it obvious enough. Give it some breathing room so it’s very easy to spot.

## Lead Capture Forms

The only purpose of a marketing form is to gather personal data, but people don’t just give up their information on a whim. To gather information effectively, you’ll need to keep 2 things in mind – the form’s design and the incentive you’re offering.

> Remove the fear of the form and you’ll increase conversion rates.

A correctly designed form can be a good opportunity for a conversion lift or an improved user experience.

The balancing act of lead capture forms:

The fear of the form <<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>> The size of the prize

### 1. Fear of the Form – Perceived and Actual Friction

Friction is the barrier to entry (effort) that your form presents to your visitors. Friction falls into two categories and has one solution:

1a. Perceived friction

This is the shock factor of suddenly being faced with a long form. The perception of having to fill out such a long form can be daunting and cause people to change their mind. A solution to this can be to split your form over more than one page.

Solution – Krug your forms

 Steve Krug famously said “Get rid of half the words on your page, then get rid of half of what’s left.” Apply this thinking to your forms by reducing the number of fields. ImageScape improved a clients’ conversion rate by 120% by reducing the number of form fields from 11 to 4. And Expedia saved $12 million a year by deleting one form field

1b. Actual friction

This is the time and trouble it takes to actually *fill in* the form, and it can cause pretty serious abandonment issues if it’s not considered. Things that can slow down – or cause frustration during – the process of form completion include:

- Too many open-ended questions that people have to ponder

- Dropdown menus that don’t include a viable option for the visitor. An example of this is the commonly asked “What industry is your business in?”. If there isn’t an answer available and you don’t provide a way out (like an “Other industry” option) then frustration can occur.

- Captcha security input fields. This is when you have to read strange looking words or letters and type in what you think they say in order to proceed.

Solution – Learn and adapt

One approach to improvement for this scenario is to analyze the results you get and adapt your form accordingly. When looking at your form data, ask yourself:

Are a high percentage of dropdown results the first option in the list? If so, you should try to make the answers as short and clearly distinguishable as possible. If people can easily/quickly read the option that applies to them, they will be more inclined to select it.

Are the responses to open-ended questions actually real answers? Or are they nonsense (such as “asdfasdf”) designed to get through the form as quickly as possible? If so, you should make the questions more direct and easier to answer. Examples would be: “Tell us about your biggest marketing problem” (requires a short story as an answer) vs. “What is the biggest barrier to your marketing success?” (which could often be answered in a few words).

> The way you ask people to complete form fields is just as important as the information you are asking for. The clearer you ask the question, the more likely you are to get an accurate response.

### 2. The size of the prize

Related to the perceived friction is the incentive you are providing to people who complete your forms. The goal here is to balance the size of the prize (your incentive) with the friction. The key to incentives is to use great content, as we’ll see below.

#### 2a. Incentives

There are many incentives for a user to give up their personal information. Examples include:

- Ebook
- Whitepaper
- Webinar registration
- Newsletter registration
- Consultation for professional services
- Discount coupon/voucher
- Contest entry
- A free trial
- A physical gift (via direct mail)
- Notification of a future product launch

To align with the concept of balancing incentive with friction, remember to ask for appropriate types of information based on your marketing goals after the conversion. For instance, if you will be sending an automated newsletter to registrants, email or email/name are all that’s needed. Whereas if you have a product/service that requires a follow-up sales call, you would want more information to qualify the level of interest.

#### 1c. Alternative Social Currency

You don’t always have to ask for an email address to give away your content. In fact, some people will actively avoid disclosing their email, due to fear of being spammed. With this in mind, you can use a service such as PayWithATweet.com, which allows a visitor to pay for your content with a Twitter or Facebook share. Take a look at the example below, in this ebook download example visitors are given the choice to provide an email or share a tweet in exchange for the ebook.

It may seem like you’re giving up email submissions, but the payoff in campaign momentum can far outweigh the sacrifice. By having people share via social networks, you produce a feedback loop that brings others to your page, giving you a steady stream of traffic even after your initial campaign launch.

## Landing Page Copywriting

The words on your page are the most important elements to consider when creating a landing page. Your words are the first thing people pay attention to when the page loads, and the last thing they read before deciding whether or not they will complete your conversion goal.

> Answer questions before the prospect is asking them

### 1. Taking Inventory

- The headline
- The subheader
- Introductory paragraph
- Benefits/feature bullet points
- The form header
- Call-to-action copy
- Privacy statements
- Testimonials (though you don’t write these, they’re part of your copy)

### 2. Crafting An Effective Headline

Your headline has one job and one job only. To get your visitors to continue engaging with your message, increase their desire for what you’re offering, and motivate a Call-To-Action click. That’s why when it comes to crafting effective landing page headlines, choose clarity over clever.

Clever calls attention to itself at the expense of the message.

### 3. Writing A Call To Action

According to Michael Aagaard, your call-to-action represents the tipping point between bounce and conversion. When you ask someone to do something online, they have to go through your call-to-action in order to do it – regardless of whether you’re asking them to download a PDF, fill out a form, buy a product, or even just click through to another page.

This means that clicking the CTA is a mission-critical conversion goal, and every extra click potentially means money in the bank.

Michael recommends asking yourself 2 questions in order to optimize your call-to-action copy:

1. What is my prospect’s motivation for clicking this button?
2. What is my prospect going to get, when he/she clicks this button?

The answers to those 2 questions are going to be the basis for the new button copy. You’ll have to spend time tweaking and refining it before it’s ready for testing, but asking these questions is a great way to get started.

Let’s use a gym membership call-to-action as an example:

1. The prospects’ motivation is to get a membership in a local gym.
2. When they click the button, they’ll get the opportunity to find a gym and buy their membership.

This leaves our final button copy as: “Find gym and get membership”

### 4. Privacy Stating Tips

The privacy policy statements you add to your lead generation forms can have a significant impact on how people perceive your trustworthiness, in turn affecting your conversion rates. Michael Aagaard ran some A/B test experiments on this in order to determine which type of messaging works best.

In the first experiment, the original form (with no privacy statement) was tested against a version that said “100% privacy – we will never spam you” beneath the call-to-action. The results of this were surprising.

### 5. Writing Benefit Statements

Listing the features of your offering requires your visitors to figure out for themselves how your product or service can help them.

A more effective way to communicate how you’ll solve their problems is to talk in terms of benefits. This lets you speak directly to the needs of your visitors as opposed to talking about yourself.

Copyblogger provides great insight into all kinds of copywriting, including an excellent technique for turning your feature descriptions into benefit driven statements.

#### How to turn your features into benefits

Copyblogger recommends a 4 step process to extract the benefits from your features, to find the underlying desires of your prospects. Using a WordPress blog theme as an example, here’s how you can create your own benefit statements:

1. List all of your product’s features. Narrowed down to the features that are most likely to hook your prospect:

   - Point-and-click site design controls
   - Mobile responsive layouts
   - One-click automatic theme updates

2. Examine what each feature does, or why you’ve included it:

   - Easily customizes your site in fewer steps
   - Adjusts to fit any device, hand-held, tablet or PC
   - Keeps your site updated and secure at the click of a button

3. Take your list of what your features do and ask yourself how they connect with your prospect’s true desires:

   - The ease and ability to change your own website in minutes without the need or expense of a developer
   - No complaints from customers that they can’t find your product or services or see your site’s content correctly on their mobile device
   - No more worrying about hours of redesigning or coding to get your site to look the way it did before platform updates

4. To get to the bottom of each feature’s true benefit, keep asking the question “What does this mean for your prospect on an emotional level?”:

   - Freedom and flexibility from having to pay a developer every time you want to change something on your website, and full creative control at your fingertips
   - The relief and happiness of knowing that your prospects will always be able to get in touch with you or buy your product or services no matter what device they are using
   - The confidence that your website is secure, looking great, and working for you regardless of how many versions of WordPress come out

or So what? method

### 6. Customer Writes for You

According to Copyhackers founder Joanna Weibe, if you want know what messages to put on your landing page, you can swipe it from your visitors, customers and prospects. The more you reflect what people are thinking, feeling and experiencing when they arrive on your landing page, the greater the likelihood that they will trust you, believe you’ve created the solution to their problems and buy from you.

In this example, a testimonial was used to extract a benefit statement of the solution offered on a landing page and use it in a new headline.

> We love our business user account. How are we using it? To elimate 99% of our paper files

#### Headline

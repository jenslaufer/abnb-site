Every Sunday I was checking the Airbnb calendars of my competitors calculating occupancy rates and comparing their rates. I was putting these data in an Excel Sheet. This took hours, was frustrating because I made so many mistakes... I am so happy that these time are gone. I was so happy when I received my Airbnb Market Analysis. Now I was able to get actionable insights on the WHOLE market and my competitors. I even identified new competitors. The report saved me a lot of time and helped me to do better.
